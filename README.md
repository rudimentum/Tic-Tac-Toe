# Tic-Tac-Toe
Building the project Tic Tac Toe for HyperSkill.

1. Tic-tac-toe is a game played by two players on a 3x3 field.

2. One of the players plays as 'X', and the other player is 'O'. 
3. 'X' plays first, then the 'O' side plays, and so on.

4. The players write 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 field.

5. The first player that writes tree 'X' or tree 'O' in a straight line (including diagonals) wins.
