## About ##
<br/>
1. Tic tac toe is a game played by two players on a 3x3 field.
<br/>
2. One of the players plays as 'X', and the other player is 'O'.
<br/>
3. 'X' plays first, then the 'O' side plays, and so on.
<br/>
4. The players write 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 field.
<br/>
5. The first player that writes tree 'X' or tree 'O' in a straight line (including diagonals) wins.
